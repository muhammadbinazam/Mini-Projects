        <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
        <p>
            <b>HTML</b> stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the core language used to create the structure and content of a web page. Every heading, paragraph, image, and link you see on a website is defined by HTML tags. Think of HTML as the skeleton of the website.
        </p>

        <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
        <p>
            <b>CSS</b>stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is used to control the visual appearance, or style, of the content created with HTML. This includes colors, fonts, layout, spacing, and animations. CSS is what makes a website look good; it's the clothes and makeup on the skeleton!
        </p>
        
        <h3>Levels of Style Sheets</h3>
        <p>
            There are three main ways to use CSS:
            <br>1. Inline: Applying styles directly to an HTML element using the `style` attribute. (Not recommended for large projects.)
            <br>2. Internal (Embedded): Putting all the CSS rules in a `<style>` tag inside the `<head>` of the HTML document. (Good for single pages.)
            <br>3. External: Placing all CSS rules in a separate file (like `styles.css`) and linking it to the HTML using the `<link>` tag. (Best practice for multi-page websites like this one!)
