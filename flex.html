      <h1 style="text-align: center">Leonardo de Vinci</h1>
      <p>
        Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) was an Italian polymath, born in the small
        town of Vinci, near Florence. He grew up with a deep sense of curiosity
        about the natural world and quickly developed skills as an artist and
        thinker. As a young apprentice in Florence, Leonardo was trained in
        painting, sculpture, and mechanical arts. His insatiable thirst for
        knowledge led him to study anatomy, mathematics, botany, and
        engineering, making him one of the most remarkable minds of the
        Renaissance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Leonardo’s artistic achievements are celebrated worldwide. His
        masterpieces such as Mona Lisa and The Last Supper are considered iconic
        works of art, admired for their lifelike detail, mastery of perspective,
        and emotional depth. Beyond painting, Leonardo sketched designs for
        flying machines, bridges, and advanced weaponry — inventions that showed
        how far ahead of his time he truly was. His detailed anatomical drawings
        remain a valuable resource for medical studies even today, highlighting
        his unmatched observational skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        Leonardo da Vinci’s legacy extends beyond his art and inventions. He is
        remembered as the ultimate Renaissance Man, someone who combined
        creativity with scientific curiosity. His notebooks, filled with
        sketches, experiments, and ideas, continue to inspire inventors,
        artists, and scientists. Leonardo’s life teaches us that knowledge has
        no boundaries, and true innovation comes from blending imagination with
        careful study.

      <p style="color: aqua; font-size: 25px;" class="footertext">About Leonardo</p>
      <p class="footertext">
        Leonardo believed that art and science are interconnected, and his life
        embodied that vision. He encouraged humanity to be curious, to observe
        the world closely, and to seek beauty in both creativity and discovery.
